ðŸ“‚ Supplementary material can be found in [files](https://github.com/andresmr13/Hexarotor_fractional_control_for_PX4/blob/main/Supplementary_material.pdf). This document contains further comparative results between the proposed fractional order control and other robust and fractional controllers from the state-of-the-art.

:open_file_folder: You may find the MATLAB Simulink [files](https://github.com/andresmr13/Hexarotor_fractional_control_for_PX4/tree/main/MATLAB_files) simulations for the MATLAB Simulink simulations section of the paper, as well as a detailed [paper](https://github.com/andresmr13/Hexarotor_fractional_control_for_PX4/blob/ebdc6eedd3ebf38e8ed9e760a6bd0a4771d149c0/MATLAB_files/TAES_2024_Flores.pdf) describing these results.

:open_file_folder: We also provide the [files](https://github.com/andresmr13/Hexarotor_fractional_control_for_PX4/tree/main/PX4_firmware_files) required to conduct the Software in the Loop simulation using Gazebo and PX4 firmware, modified to use our proposed fractional-order controller.
