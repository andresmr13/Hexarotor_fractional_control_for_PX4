# Hexarotor_fractional_control_for_PX4
This repository contains complementary material for the paper "Fractional-order position control for the fully-actuated Hexa-rotor: SITL simulations in the PX4 firmware".

You may find the MATLAB Simulink files simulations for the complementary MATLAB Simulink simulations section of the paper, as well as a detailed document ([I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)) describing these results.
We also provide the files required to conduct the Software in the Loop simulation using Gazebo and PX4 firmware, modified to use our proposed fractional-order controller.

Further information coming soon!
