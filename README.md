## "Fractional-order position control for the fully-actuated Hexa-rotor: SITL simulations in the PX4 firmware"
This repository contains complementary material for the above paper.

You may find the MATLAB Simulink files simulations for the complementary MATLAB Simulink simulations section of the paper, as well as a detailed [document](https://github.com/andresmr13/Hexarotor_fractional_control_for_PX4/blob/main/Complementary_simulations.pdf) describing these results.
We also provide the files required to conduct the Software in the Loop simulation using Gazebo and PX4 firmware, modified to use our proposed fractional-order controller.

Further information coming soon!
